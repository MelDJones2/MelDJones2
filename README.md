<h2>💬 About Me:</h2>
<p>I have a strong interest in software development as a student, particularly in the fields of cybersecurity and neural networks. I read a lot of technology literature out of school to keep up with developments in the topics I study.</p>
<p><b>My favorite books about Computer Science include:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>"The Coming Wave" by Mustafa Suleyman</li>
  <li>"Life 3.0" by Max Tegmark</li>
  <li>"The Filter Bubble" by Eli Pariser</li>
  <li>"The Innovators" by Walter Isaacson</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, I enjoy problem-solving on <a href="https://leetcode.com/MelJWise/">LeetCode</a> to refine my programming skills.</p>
